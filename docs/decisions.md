# Decision log (tree)

Institutional memory of the project. Every design exploration gets a node: **TRIED** (with the
actual error/measurement), **FAILED/OK**, **CHOSEN** and why. Update in the same session as the
exploration. Nested bullets = sub-decisions opened by a parent choice.

Legend: ✅ chosen · ❌ tried & rejected (keep the evidence!) · 🔬 open, needs PoC · 🅱️ fallback kept viable

## 1. Execution model

- ✅ **Device-side megakernel VM** (persistent kernel, opcode switch) — user decision 2026-07-14.
  Motivation: minimal dispatch overhead.
  - ✅ **Strictly linear bytecode, no jumps/conditionals** — user decision 2026-07-14. StableHLO has
    no jump ops (verified against spec, see docs/stablehlo-notes.md); region ops (`while`/`if`/
    `case`/`reduce`/...) lower to one instruction referencing nested linear instruction lists,
    interpreted by the VM.
    - ❌ pc-manipulation/jumps in bytecode — rejected: user prefers stupid-linear execution;
      nothing in StableHLO needs it.
    - ✅ **Nested-list control flow VALIDATED 2026-07-14** (`poc/01` test4): `OP_WHILE` with
      cond/body sub-list refs + explicit frame stack in the interpreter; 2-deep nesting passes on
      PoCL + NVIDIA.
      - ⚠️ **Lesson**: the cond scalar MUST be read with `atomic_add(p,0)` — a plain load hit
        stale per-SM cache on NVIDIA, diverged the workgroups' loop decision, and deadlocked the
        barrier (PoCL was fine). Rule: uniform-control-flow values are always read atomically.
  - ✅ **Cross-workgroup barrier — VALIDATED 2026-07-14** (`poc/01-device-vm`): Xiao&Feng-style
    arrival counter + phase flag with OpenCL **1.2** atomics passes correctness + 2000-instr
    dependency stress on both PoCL (24 grp) and NVIDIA (188 grp, ~1.1 µs/barrier). Megakernel vs
    separate launches on NVIDIA: **2.5x faster @1M-elem ops, 3.2x @4K** — the design pays off.
    Rules: never launch more groups than co-resident capacity (= CUs for now; PoCL would deadlock
    otherwise); 1.2-relaxed-atomics barrier is technically outside the 1.2 memory model —
    follow-up: feature-detect OpenCL 2.0 `atomic_load_explicit(memory_scope_device)` path.
  - 🔬 **Opcode dispatch** — no function pointers in OpenCL C → single big switch (works fine in
    poc/01); risk: compile time/register pressure as op library grows. Mitigation candidate:
    split VM by op family.
  - 🅱️ **Host-side dispatch loop** over the same bytecode (one clEnqueueNDRangeKernel per instr).
    Keep the bytecode dual-interpretable so this fallback stays cheap to activate.

## 2. StableHLO ingestion

- ❌ **Link MLIR + StableHLO C++ libs, built via CMake** — was the plan (user decision 2026-07-14),
  dropped 2026-07-14. Original trigger was a disk scare that turned out WRONG (I measured the
  root overlay, ~3 GB free; `/home/ubuntu/project` is a separate mount with ~445 GB — user
  corrected this). The pivot stands anyway on merits: python lowering is version-matched to JAX,
  no LLVM rebuild per JAX upgrade, hackable compile logic. C++ MLIR build (in `third_party/`
  inside the project mount) is a VIABLE fallback again, e.g. for a future C++ `vm` dialect.
  Prebuilt escape hatches checked and still dead:
  - ❌ Link jaxlib's bundled MLIR: `libjax_common.so` (334 MB, contains all of MLIR+StableHLO)
    exports only 27 dynamic symbols — Python module init wrappers; the MLIR C API is hidden.
    Verified with `nm -D` 2026-07-14. Not linkable.
  - ❌ LLVM release-tarball prebuilts + stablehlo source: stablehlo pins non-release LLVM commits;
    extracted tarballs alone (~10 GB) don't fit either.
- ✅ **Python-side lowering, out-of-process** (previously rejected, revived by the disk evidence —
  and it's arguably better): lowering is compile-time-only, so the C++ plugin spawns the venv
  Python (`sys.executable` passed via `register_plugin(..., options=...)` →
  `PJRT_Client_Create` create_options) as a subprocess during `PJRT_Client_Compile`, pipes the
  serialized VHLO artifact in, receives flat VMProgram bytecode out. Uses jaxlib's own StableHLO
  Python bindings ⇒ **version-matched to JAX by construction**, zero heavy C++ deps, lowering is
  plain debuggable Python. C++ side stays a pure executor. → `poc/03-python-lowering`
  - ❌ In-process CPython callback instead of subprocess — rejected: GIL re-entrancy from inside a
    PJRT C call is a hazard; subprocess is ~100s of ms per compile, acceptable.
  - 🔬 Custom MLIR `vm` dialect (from original plan) deferred; VMProgram is a plain binary format
    emitted by Python for now.
  - ❌ Hand-written textual-MLIR parser — fragile across JAX/MLIR versions, can't read
    bytecode/VHLO artifacts.

## 3. Kernel strategy

- ✅ **Generic shape-agnostic kernel library** (strides/shapes as runtime args), compiled once per
  device at init, program binaries cached on disk. Start with a tiny op set, expand only when e2e
  works — user decision 2026-07-14.
  - 🔬 Kernel-table override mechanism for tuned per-vendor variants (M5), incl. specialized matmul.

## 4. PJRT layer

- ✅ **Hand-rolled PJRT C API — VALIDATED 2026-07-14** (`poc/02-pjrt-skeleton`): `jax.devices()`
  returns our OclDevice on both NVIDIA and PoCL with ~650 lines of C++, one vendored header,
  CMake+Ninja (~3 s build), zero XLA source dep. User's failure prediction did not materialize.
  ~30 of 138 API entries suffice for device enumeration. Incident log (full detail in
  `poc/02-pjrt-skeleton/NOTES.md`):
  - jaxlib dlsym's **`GetPjrtApi`** (lowercase "rt"), not `GetPjRtApi` as some docs write.
  - `PJRT_Error_ForEachPayload` must work from day one — stubbing it → infinite error recursion
    → core dump (framework calls it on every error).
  - `PJRT_Device_GetAttributes` returning UNIMPLEMENTED is a CHECK-crash (`LogFatalIfPjrtError`),
    not catchable; empty attributes are fine. Expect more CHECK-crash (not error) contracts in
    Compile/Execute/Event callbacks at M2 — implement those to spec, not as stubs.
  - Keep the trick: every stub returns UNIMPLEMENTED **carrying its own callback name** —
    makes each new jax version/feature self-diagnosing.
  - 🅱️ XLA C++ wrapper route (`pjrt_c_api_wrapper_impl.h`, full Bazel build) — retired unless the
    async Event contract proves intractable by hand.

## 4b. jax/PJRT version pin

- ✅ jax/jaxlib **0.10.2** ⇒ XLA pin via `third_party/xla/revision.bzl` at tag `jax-v0.10.2` ⇒
  XLA commit `5a9e73cbd92530cac2ac36f4736a774b2412afe2` ⇒ **PJRT C API 0.112** (vendored at
  `poc/02-pjrt-skeleton/vendor/pjrt_c_api.h`). Exact minor match ⇒ no ENABLE_PJRT_COMPATIBILITY
  needed. Recipe documented for future bumps.

## 5. Python packaging / discovery

- ✅ **Entry-points discovery** (`[project.entry-points.'jax_plugins']`) — recommended by openxla
  docs over bare `jax_plugins/` namespace dirs. `initialize()` calls
  `xla_bridge.register_plugin('opencl', priority=500, library_path=..., options=None)`.
  priority>400 makes it win under `JAX_PLATFORMS=''`; during dev prefer explicit `JAX_PLATFORMS=opencl`.
  - 🔬 jaxlib ↔ PJRT C API version matching is strict (no ABI guarantee yet): pin JAX and record the
    `PJRT_Api` major/minor we build against.

## 6. Naming

- ✅ **pjrt-ocl** (python package `pjrt_ocl`, JAX platform name `opencl`) — picked from user's
  shortlist (pjrt-ocl / pjrt-ocl-mk / ocl-ext-xla) 2026-07-14.

## 7. Backend selection

- ✅ **CPU-first development on PoCL**, then NVIDIA, then Intel/AMD — user decision 2026-07-14.
  Rationale: printf/debuggers/sanitizers work on a CPU OpenCL runtime.
- ✅ **Backend configurable**: `PJRT_OCL_DEVICE=<platform substring>[:<device index>]` env var,
  overridable via PJRT client-create options; default = first GPU, else first CPU.

## 8. Environment

- ✅ NVIDIA ICD registered manually 2026-07-14: `/etc/OpenCL/vendors/nvidia.icd` ←
  `libnvidia-opencl.so.1` (was missing; clinfo now lists the RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell).
- ✅ PoCL installed 2026-07-14 (`pocl-opencl-icd`): platform "Portable Computing Language",
  device cpu-haswell (AMD Ryzen 9 3900X).
